## Description
This dashboard shows the  Electric power consumption(kWh per capita) of different countries in the world during the years 1980 to 2010.
The dashboard contains two charts. The first one represents an overview of power consumption of different regions of the world. It is a stacked bar chart that shows how the consumption has changed every 5 years.The second chart represents the usage details of different countries and how much access to electricity these countries have.

In the first chart, the x-axis represent the years and the y-axis represents the electric power consumption. A stacked bar chart is used because the electric power consumption is a quantitative continuous value and the years are quantitative discrete values. Stacked bars represent the consumption by different regions. Every region is represented by a unique color.

In the second chart, years are quantitative discrete value and power consumption is quantitative continuous value.So, a Gantt chart is used. This chart shows the detailed power consumption by different countries in the world. Red-Green Colour palette shows the power consumption by each individual in the country. Green indicates low consumption and Red indicates high consumption. The percentage of access to electricity for each of these years is indicated by the size of the square.
